This repo contains an example project 

Ideas behind this project include:

 - codebase must be easy to maintain and scale
 - code must be easy to refactor
 - an IDE should provide good autocomplete with minimal setup
 - use as little magic as possible, even better to remove them at all
 - if possible, make code independent on a framework
 - Avoid using Eloquent relationships

### TODO:

 - move console, http kernels and RouteProvider to Core folder
 - write installation guide
 - add to readme patterns used in the project
 - add CI/CD
